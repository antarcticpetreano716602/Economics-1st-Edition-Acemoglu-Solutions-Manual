  * Acemoglu, Laibson, List: An evidence-based approach to economics
  * Throughout Economics, authors Daron Acemoglu, David Laibson, and John List use real economic questions and data to help students learn about the world around them.
 
  * Taking a fresh approach, the authors use the themes of optimization, equilibrium and empiricism to illustrate the power of simple economic ideas, and their ability to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. Each chapter begins with an empirical question that is later answered using data in the Evidence-Based Economics feature. As a result of the text’s practical emphasis, students will learn to apply economic principles to guide the decisions they make in their own lives.

Preface
As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is it alive.
-David Hilbert, Paris, 1900
This book is intended to serve two purposes. First and foremost, this is a book about
economic growth and long-run economic development. The process of economic growth
and the sources of differences in economic performance across nations are some of
the most interesting, important and challenging areas in modern social science. The primary
purpose of this book is to introduce graduate students to these major questions and to the
theoretical tools necessary for studying them. The book therefore strives to provide students
with a strong background in dynamic economic analysis, since only such a background will
enable a serious study of economic growth and economic development. I also try to provide a
clear discussion of the broad empirical patterns and historical processes underlying the current
state of the world economy. This narrative is motivated by my belief that to understand why
some countries grow and others fail to do so, economists have to move beyond the mechanics
of models and pose questions about the fundamental causes of economic growth.
Second, In a somewhat different capacity, this book is also a graduate-level introduction to
modern macroeconomics and dynamic economic analysis. It is sometimes commented that,
unlike basic microeconomic theory, there is no core of current macroeconomic theory that
is shared by all economists. This is not entirely true. While there is disagreement among
macroeconomists about how to approach short-run macroeconomic phenomena and what the
boundaries of macroeconomics should be, there is broad agreement about the workhorse
models of dynamic macroeconomic analysis. These include the Solow growth model, the
neoclassical growth model, the overlapping generations model, and models of technological
change and technology adoption. Since these are all models of economic growth, a thorough
treatment of modern economic growth can also provide (and perhaps should provide) an
introduction to this core material of modern macroeconomics. Although there are several
good graduate-level macroeconomic textbooks, they typically spend relatively little time on the
basic core material and do not develop the links between modern macroeconomic analysis and
economic dynamics on the one hand and general equilibrium theory on the other. In contrast,
the current book does not cover any of the short-run topics in macroeconomics, but provides
a thorough and rigorous introduction to what I view to be the core of macroeconomics.
The selection of topics is designed to strike a balance between the two purposes of the book.
Chapters 1, 3, and 4 introduce many of the salient features of the process of economic growth
and the sources of cross-country differences in economic performance. Even though these

xvi . Preface
chapters cannot do justice to the large literature on economic growth empirics, they provide
a sufficient background for students to appreciate the issues that are central to the study of
economic growth and a platform for further study of this large literature.
Chapters 5-7 cover the conceptual and mathematical foundations of modern macroeconomic
analysis. Chapter 5 provides the microfoundations for much of the rest of the book (and
for much of modern macroeconomics), while Chapters 6 and 7 supply a quick but relatively
rigorous introduction to dynamic optimization. Most books on macroeconomics or economic
growth use either continuous time or discrete time exclusively. I believe that a serious study of
both economic growth and modern macroeconomics requires the student (and the researcher)
to be able to move between formulations using discrete and continuous time, choosing the
more convenient or appropriate approach for the set of questions at hand. Therefore I have
deviated from standard practice and included both continuous-time and discrete-time material
throughout the book.
Chapters 2, 8, 9, and 10 introduce the basic workhorse models of modern macroeconomics
and traditional economic growth, while Chapter 11 presents the first-generation models of
sustained (endogenous) economic growth. Chapters 12-15 cover models of technological
progress, which are an essential part of any modern economic growth course.
Chapter 16 generalizes the tools introduced in Chapter 6 to stochastic environments. Using
these tools, Chapter 17 presents a number of models of stochastic growth-most notably the
neoclassical growth model under uncertainty, which is the foundation of much of modern
macroeconomics (though it is often left out of courses on economic growth). The canonical
Real Business Cycle model is presented as an application. This chapter also covers another
majorworkhorse model of modern macroeconomics, the incomplete markets model of Bewley.
Finally, Chapter 17 also presents a number of other approaches to modeling the interaction
between incomplete markets and economic growth and shows howmodels of stochastic growth
can be useful in understanding how economies transition from stagnation or slow growth to an
equilibrium with sustained growth.
Chapters 18-21 cover topics that are sometimes left out of economic growth textbooks.
These include models of technology adoption, technology diffusion, the interaction between
international trade and technology, the process of structural change, the demographic transition,
the possibility of poverty traps, the effects of inequality on economic growth and the
interaction between financial and economic development. These topics are important for creating
a bridge between the empirical patterns we observe in practice and the theory. Most
traditional growth models consider a single economy in isolation, often after it has already
embarked on a process of steady economic growth. A study of models that incorporate crosscountry
interdependences, structural change and the possibility of takeoffs make it possible
to link core topics of development economics, such as structural change, poverty traps or the
demographic transition, to the theory of economic growth.
Finally, Chapters 22 and 23 consider another topic often omitted from macroeconomics
and economic growth textbooks: political economy. Inclusion of this material is motivated
by my belief that the study of economic growth would be seriously hampered if we failed to
ask questions about the fundamental causes of differences among countries in their economic
performances. These questions inexorably bring us to differences in economic policies and
institutions across nations. Political economy enables us to develop models to understand why
economic policies and institutions differ across countries and must therefore be an integral part
of the study of economic growth.
Afewwords on the philosophy and organization of the book might also be useful for students
and teachers. The underlying philosophy of the book is that all the results that are stated should
be proved or at least explained in detail. This implies a somewhat different organization than
found in other books. Most textbooks in economics do not provide proofs for many of the
Acemoglu first pages 2008/8/24 11:21 p. xvi (front) Princeton Editorial Assoc., JRS ZzTEX 13.6
Preface . xvii
results that are stated or invoked, and mathematical tools that are essential for the analysis are
often taken for granted or developed in appendixes. In contrast, I have strived to provide simple
proofs of almost all results stated in this book. It turns out that once unnecessary generality is
removed, most results can be stated and proved in a way that is easily accessible to graduate
students. In fact, I believe that even somewhat long proofs are much easier to understand than
general statements made without proof, which leave the readerwondering why these statements
are true.
I hope that the style I have chosen not only makes the book self-contained, but also gives the
students an opportunity to develop a thorough understanding of the material. In line with this
philosophy, I present the basic mathematical tools necessary for the development of the main
material in the body of the text. My own experience suggests that a linear progression, where
the necessary mathematical tools are introduced when needed, makes it easier for the students
to follow and appreciate the material. Consequently, analysis of the stability of dynamical
systems, dynamic programming in discrete time and optimal control in continuous time are
all introduced in the main body of the text. This should both help the students appreciate the
foundations of the theory of economic growth and provide them with an introduction to the
main tools of dynamic economic analysis, which are increasingly used in every subdiscipline
of economics. Throughout, when some material is technically more difficult and can be skipped
without loss of continuity, it is marked with an asterisk (*). Material that is only tangentially
related to the main results in the text or that should be familiar to most graduate students is left
for the appendixes.
I have also included a large number of exercises. Students can gain a thorough understanding
of the material only by working through the exercises. Exercises that are somewhat more
difficult are also marked with an asterisk.
This book can be used in a number of different ways. First, it can be used in a one-quarter
or one-semester course on economic growth. Such a course might start with Chapters 1-4,
then depending on the nature of the course, use Chapters 5-7 either for a thorough study
of the general equilibrium and dynamic optimization foundations of growth theory or only
for reference. Chapters 8-11 cover traditional growth theory, and Chapters 12-15 provide the
basics of endogenous growth theory. Depending on time and interest, any selection of Chapters
16-23 can be used for the last part of such a course.
Second, the book can be used for a one-quarter first-year graduate-level course in macroeconomics.
In this case, Chapter 1 would be optional. Chapters 2, 5-7, 8-11, 16-17 and a
selection from 12-15 would be the core of such a course. The same material could also be
covered in a one-semester course, but in this case, it could be supplemented either with some
of the later chapters or with material from one of the leading graduate-level macroeconomic
textbooks on short-run macroeconomics, fiscal policy, asset pricing, or other topics in dynamic
macroeconomics.
Third, the book can be used for an advanced (second-year) course in economic growth or
economic development. An advanced course on growth or development could use Chapters
1-11 as background and then focus on selected chapters from Chapters 12-23.
Finally, since the book is self-contained, I also hope that it can be used for self-study.
